<h1>Welcome to IPA trainer!</h1>

This site offers a tool for lectures who teach IPA characters and for students who learn IPA characters to do so in a way that is more interesting and fun.<br><br>

<img src="<?PHP print(ROOT_URL); ?>/user/site/images/001.jpg" align="right">

Everything on this site is free. I made it as a part of an exam at the University of Troms√∏, and work on it and maintain it for fun.<br><br>
