<h1>Credits:</h1>

<b>Thanks go to...</b>
<ul>
	<li>...the University of Victoria, Humanities Computing and Media Centre by Martin Holmes & Shannon West for allowing me to use the graphics from their <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/ipa/" target="_BLANK">IPAKeypad</a> for this site. Thus saving me an huge amount of work.<br><br>
	<li>...professor J. C. Wells at the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics at the University College London for allowing me to use the sounds from <i>The Sounds of the International Phonetic Alphabet</i> on this site. <br><br>
	<li>...my lecturer in English phonetics at the University of Tromsø, Martin Krämer for allowing me to hand in this project as my final exam in his course. In this way I could spend lots more time on it than I could have if I was to use only my spare time.<br><br>
	<li>...my king and saviour Jesus Christ who loved me and gave himself for me.
</ul>
